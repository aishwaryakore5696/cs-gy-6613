The course schedule below highlights our journey to understand the multiple subsystems and how they can be connected together to create compelling but, currently, domain specific forms of intelligence. 

## Books

1. [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, by Stuart Russell, 3rd edition, 2010](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Approach-Stuart-Russell/dp/9332543518/ref=sr_1_2?crid=17NGBV1XXV150&keywords=ai+a+modern+approach&qid=1576432665&sprefix=ai+the+modern+appr%2Caps%2C158&sr=8-2)
2. [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, by Stuart Russell, 4th edition, 2020](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/dp/0134610997/ref=sr_1_3?crid=17NGBV1XXV150&keywords=ai+a+modern+approach&qid=1576432686&sprefix=ai+the+modern+appr%2Caps%2C158&sr=8-3)

The publisher is about to release the 4th edition (2020) of this classic. I will be monitoring availability in bookstores and highlighting the differences on a per topic basis. You will be OK with 3rd edition but if you are buying new, get the latest edition.  

## Schedule & Handouts

The schedule is based on [Academic Calendar Spring 2020](https://www.nyu.edu/registrar/calendars/university-academic-calendar.html): 

1. **Week 1 (1/27/2020)** We start with an introduction to AI by going over what are the components that constitute an AI system. We develop a map that will guide us through the rest of the course as we deep dive into each component. 
          
2. **Week 2 (2/3/2020)**  The perception subsystem is at the outer shell of the AI system. Its function is to process and fuse multimodal sensory inputs. Perception is implemented via a number of reflexive agents that map directly perceived state to an primitive action such as regressing on the frame coordinates of an object in the scene. We present the learning problem both for classification and regression and the path from classical machine learning algorithms to today's deep neural networks. DNNs are developed bottom up from the Perceptron algorithm. The learning problem MLPs learn via optimization approaches such as Stochastic Gradient Descent.  
          
3. **Week 3 (2/10/2020)** We deep-dive into back-propagation - a fundamental for the efficient training of DNNs and how this is applied the most dominant DNN architecture today -  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  
            
4. **Week 4: (2/17/2020)** We cover few key perception building blocks, Object detection, semantic and instance segmentation.    
             
5. **Week 5: (2/24/2020)** This week we address Linear Classification and learn how to interpret key performance metrics that arise in classification. We also cover one foundational algorithm - the Perceptron.
        
6. **Week 6: (3/2/2020)** We continue on classification and address kernel methods and Support Vector Machines - classifiers that are used extensively even in today's deep learning dominated field, due to to their small computational latency and predictability. 
        
7. **Week 7: (3/9/2020)**  The setting this week changes to that of unsupervised learning. We review workhorses of ML such as K-means, KNN and Decision Trees. 
        
8. **Week 8: (3/16/2020)**  Spring Recess - no class
        
9. **Week 9: (3/23/2020)**  
    
10. **Week 10: (3/30/2020)**  
        
        
11. **Week 11: (4/6/2020)**  
        
        
12. **Week 12: (4/13/2020)**  
        
        
13. **Week 13: (4/20/2020)**  Enjoy your Spring Break.
        
        
14. **Week 14: (4/27/2019)**  
            
15. **Week 15: (5/05/2020)**  In this last lecture, we review what we learned and emphasize what kind of questions you are expected to answer in the final exam.  
        
16. **Week 16: (5/11/2020)** Review week. 
        
17. **Week 17**  Good luck with your final test.
