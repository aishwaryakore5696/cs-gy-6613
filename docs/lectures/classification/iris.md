By definition a confusion matrix $C$ is such that $C_{i, j}$is equal to the number of observations known to be in group $i$ but predicted to be in group $j$.  Thus in binary classification, the count of true negatives is $C_{0,0}$, false negatives is :$C_{1,0}$, true positives is $C_{1,1}$ and false positives is $C_{0,1}$.
